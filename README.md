# Partial fourier 
Partial fourier reconstruction of MRI images 
Our goal is to use deep learning for partial fourier reconstruction of 6/8 , 5/8 and 0.55 MRI images. 

Tasks 

Jan 31 2024 - Implementation of POCS in MRI data (POCS implementation folder)

Feb 6 2024 - 4/8 , 5/8 and 6/8 reconstruction of PF using POCS (POCS implementation folder)

Feb 13 2024 - Understanding and implementation of GRAPPA  

March 2024 - Understanding the DL- partial fourier dataset preparation and model training

April 2024 - Implementation of DL-PF on single coil MRI images
