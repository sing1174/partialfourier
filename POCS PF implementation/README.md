Implemented POCS (Projection onto convex set) PF (Partial fourier) on MATLAB on "sample_data.mat". 
This data is 6/8 Partial fourier data with dimensions [148,111,32,10]. 
1st and 2nd dimension represent size of k-space. 3rd dimension is number of channel/coils in MRI. 4th dimension is slice number.

We implement POCS-PF reconstruction for 4/8 , 5/8 and 6/8 of K space
